                            WHAT WAS BUILT
================================================================================

✅ CORE SYSTEM
   • Scouting Data Service (lib/services/scouting_data_service.dart)
     - Loads JSON data from assets
     - Parses stats, videos, descriptions
     - Handles errors gracefully

   • Updated Scouting Widget (lib/widgets/scouting/scouting_widget.dart)
     - Uses data service instead of hardcoded values
     - Shows loading/error states
     - Has refresh button for manual updates

   • Data File (assets/data/scouting_data.json)
     - Your actual statistics
     - Video selections (up to 4)
     - Auto routine description
     - Timestamps

✅ COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION (9 GUIDES)
   1. START_HERE.md                 - Overview & quick start
   2. READING_GUIDE.md              - Which guide to read when
   3. QUICK_UPDATE_GUIDE.md         - Daily update process (2 min read)
   4. FILE_LOCATIONS.md             - Where to find files
   5. SCOUTING_DATA_UPDATE.md       - Detailed technical documentation
   6. DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md           - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify/self-hosted
